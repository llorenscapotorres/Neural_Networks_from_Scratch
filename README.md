# Neural Networks from Scratch

This repository is dedicated to building and understanding **neural networks from the ground up**. Here, you'll find a collection of neural network implementations created with pure **Python** and **NumPy**. The goal is to demystify the core concepts of deep learning by providing clear, well-documented code that avoids high-level frameworks.

## ‚ú® What's Inside?

- **Implementations from Scratch**: Every component, from layers to optimizers, is built manually to provide a hands-on learning experience.

- **Fundamental Concepts**: Explore and understand key deep learning principles, including:

  - **Backpropagation**: The engine that powers learning in neural networks.

  - **Activation Functions**: Learn how non-linear functions like ReLU and Sigmoid introduce complexity.

  - **Loss Functions**: Understand how to measure the performance of a model.

  - **Optimizers**: Dive into algorithms like **Gradient Descent** and **Adam** that adjust model weights.
